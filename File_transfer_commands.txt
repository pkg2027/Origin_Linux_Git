1. scp (Secure Copy):
● scp is a command-line tool used to securely transfer files between a local and a remote
host or between two remote hosts over SSH (Secure Shell).
● Syntax for copying from local to remote: scp [options] local_file
remote_user@remote_host:remote_path
● Syntax for copying from remote to local: scp [options]
remote_user@remote_host:remote_path local_path
● Example: scp file.txt user@example.com:/remote/directory/ copies the file
"file.txt" from the local system to the remote host "example.com" into the directory
"/remote/directory/".
1. Copy from local to server
scp -i "/Users/kamal/OneDrive/Desktop/votingproject.pem" ffilee2.txt
ubuntu@ec2-99-79-194-251.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu
Create file on local
Now copy this file from local to server:
2. Copy from server to local
scp -i "/Users/kamal/OneDrive/Desktop/votingproject.pem" -r
ubuntu@ec2-99-79-194-251.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com
:/home/ubuntu/cloud1 .

2. rsync:
● rsync is a powerful command-line utility used for file synchronization and transfer.
● It is particularly useful for synchronizing files between local and remote systems or
between directories on the same system.
● Syntax: rsync [options] source destination
● Example: rsync -avz /local/directory/
user@example.com:/remote/directory/ synchronizes the contents of the local
directory "/local/directory/" with the directory "/remote/directory/" on the remote host
"example.com".

3. sftp (SSH File Transfer Protocol):
● sftp is a command-line tool and interactive file transfer protocol similar to FTP, but it
operates over an encrypted SSH connection.
● It provides a secure way to transfer files between hosts and perform file operations
such as listing directories, uploading, and downloading files.
● Syntax: sftp [options] user@hostname
● Example: sftp user@example.com starts an interactive SFTP session with the remote
host "example.com".

###

4. wget and curl:
● wget and curl are command-line tools used for downloading files from remote
servers.
● They support various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and FTPS.
● Syntax for wget: wget [options] URL
● Syntax for curl: curl [options] URL
● Example with wget: wget http://example.com/file.txt downloads the file
"file.txt" from the URL "http://example.com/".
● Example with curl: curl -O http://example.com/file.txt downloads the file
"file.txt" from the URL "http://example.com/".

###

5. FTP (File Transfer Protocol):
● FTP is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a
server on a computer network.
● It operates over TCP/IP and supports both ASCII and binary file transfer modes.
● Various FTP clients such as ftp, lftp, and graphical clients like FileZilla are available
for transferring files using FTP.
These file transfer commands and protocols offer different features and capabilities, allowing users to
transfer files securely and efficiently between systems in a Unix-like environment. The choice of
command or protocol depends on factors such as security requirements, network configuration, and
user preferences

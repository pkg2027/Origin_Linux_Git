Forking A Repository On Github
What is forking and how does it work? To Fork a project you are basically cloning
someone else’s original project from Github and adding it to your repository. This
will allow you to modify the project without interfering with the owner’s original
project.

1)Head over to Github and create an account if you don’t have one already.

2)Next search for the repository you would like to fork.

3)Click the fork button in the upper-righthand corner to add to your repository.

To add this forked project to our local machine, we will go back into our terminal and
type the command

Clone The Forked Repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo.git

Make Changes :-
git add . # To stage the changes
git commit -m "Enter Your commit message here"
git push origin main # Replace 'main' with the branch you want to push to.

Updating Your Fork: If you wanna keep your forked repo up-to-date with
the latest awesomeness from the original repo, no worries! Here’s the secret
sauce! First, add the original repo as an “upstream” remote with this
command:
git remote add upstream
https://github.com/original-repo-owner/original-repo.git

Then, fetch all the juicy changes from the upstream repo using:
git fetch upstream

Now, it’s time to merge those updates into your local repo! Just
switch to the branch you wanna update (usually ‘master’) and run:

git checkout master
git merge upstream/master # Replace 'master' with your branch name if
it's different.
git push origin master
Done!

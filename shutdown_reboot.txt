shutdown and reboot:
● These commands are used to shut down or reboot the system.
● The shutdown command can be used to schedule a system shutdown or reboot at a
specified time, and it also allows sending a message to users.
● Example: shutdown -r now reboots the system immediately.
● Example: shutdown +10 "System will be rebooting in 10 minutes"
schedules a system reboot in 10 minutes.
Done!
